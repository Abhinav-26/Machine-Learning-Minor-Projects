# Network-Intrusion-Detection
Created a Machine Learning model to check the network is under attack or not.
I have used five feature selection techniques in a sequence to find the best features in the dataset.
-	Correlation based feature selection
-	Univariate Feature Selection
-	Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
-	Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
-	Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)


Please download the dataset from this link http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup.data_10_percent.gz
then extract it and convert its extension to .csv
Thank you!
