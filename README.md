# Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects
In this repository you can get some minor projects in the Machine Learning domain to learn and practise and increase your Skills. I will be sharing my own small projects which I did during learning ML and understanding the concepts of different algorithms and implementing it.

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Verzeo%20InternShip">
  Verzeo Internship
  </a><br>
In this Directory you can see my project which I got during my Machine Learning Internship at 
<a href="https://verzeo.in/">Verzeo</a>. The project that I did in this training was on appstore datset.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Co2%20Emission%20Prediction">Co2 Emission Prediction</a><br>
In this directory you can see a basic machine learning model on Carbondioxide Emission Prediction whihc has been created by using Linear Regression concept.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/K-Nearest%20Neighbors">K-Nearest Neighbors</a><br>
In this directory a basic machine learning model is being created for classifying the class of the new coustomers among 
1- Basic Service, 2- E-Service, 3- Plus Service, 4-Total Service.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Drug%20Prescribtion%20Using%20DecisionTree">Drug Prescribtion using Decision Tree</a><br>
In this directory I have created a model for predicting the drug which needs to be given to patients having the same disease as per the previous experience and the model created have a 100% accuracy, tested on the 30 of the dataset which was not given for training.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/SVM%20Cancer%20Prediction">SVM Cancer Prediction</a><br>
In this directory I have created a model using SVM algorithm. The dataset used for creating the model is a record of cell samples of the patients. The dataset consists of 699 records and I got accuracy around 95% with accuracy_score and f1 score.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor Projects/tree/master/Logistic%20Regression%20on%20Churn%20Dataset">Logistic Regression on Churn Dataset</a><br>
In this directory you can see a basic prediction using the concept of Logistic Regression. I have used the Churn dataset for predicting coustomer's churn.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Phone%20Price%20Range%20Prediction">Phone Price Prediction</a><br>
In this directory I have crrated a model for predicting the range of price of a phone. The range lies between 1,2,3 ie, low, medium and high budget.
