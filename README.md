# Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects
In this repository you can get some minor projects in the Machine Learning domain to learn and practise and increase your Skills. we will be sharing my own small projects which we did during learning ML and understanding the concepts of different algorithms and implementing it.

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Verzeo%20InternShip">
  Verzeo Internship
  </a><br>
In this Directory you can see my project which we got during my Machine Learning Internship at 
<a href="https://verzeo.in/">Verzeo</a>. The project that we did in this training was on appstore datset.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Co2%20Emission%20Prediction">Co2 Emission Prediction</a><br>
In this directory you can see a basic machine learning model on Carbondioxide Emission Prediction whihc has been created by using Linear Regression concept.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/K-Nearest%20Neighbors">K-Nearest Neighbors</a><br>
In this directory a basic machine learning model is being created for classifying the class of the new coustomers among 
1- Basic Service, 2- E-Service, 3- Plus Service, 4-Total Service.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Drug%20Prescribtion%20Using%20DecisionTree">Drug Prescribtion using Decision Tree</a><br>
In this directory we have created a model for predicting the drug which needs to be given to patients having the same disease as per the previous experience and the model created have a 100% accuracy, tested on the 30 of the dataset which was not given for training.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/SVM%20Cancer%20Prediction">SVM Cancer Prediction</a><br>
In this directory we have created a model using SVM algorithm. The dataset used for creating the model is a record of cell samples of the patients. The dataset consists of 699 records and we got accuracy around 95% with accuracy_score and f1 score.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor Projects/tree/master/Logistic%20Regression%20on%20Churn%20Dataset">Logistic Regression on Churn Dataset</a><br>
In this directory you can see a basic prediction using the concept of Logistic Regression. we have used the Churn dataset for predicting coustomer's churn.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Phone%20Price%20Range%20Prediction">Phone Price Prediction</a><br>
In this directory we have crrated a model for predicting the range of price of a phone. The range lies between 1,2,3 ie, low, medium and high budget. we have implemented the concepts of Univariate Feature Selection and Feature Importance for selecting features from the dataset and then created a model for prediction. Also we used have used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and KNN algorithms and we got better accuracy by using LogisticRegression algo in this case. we got accuracy around 96% for that.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Coustomer%20Segmentation%20using%20K-Means%20Clustering">Customer Sementation Using K-means Clustering</a><br>
In this directory we have used the concept of K-means Clustering and made a model using customer segmentation dataset. It helps to cluster records on the basis of graph plotted.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Cars%20Segmentation%20using%20Heirarichal%20Clustering">Cars Segmentation using Heirarichal Clustering</a><br>
In this direcory we have created a car segmentation which may help you to classify the kinds of cars are more popular among coustomers and may help you to launch your car as per the survey. For this minor project we used the concept Hierarchical Clustering.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Movie%20Recomendation">Movie Recomendation</a><br>
In this directory we have created a Movie Recomendation system using the concept of content based recomendation system. The dataset used is very large and hence it cannot be directly Uploaded into GitHub. But you can download the data directly from <a href="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/moviedataset.zip">here</a>. Unzip the data and use the respected csv files.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Reddit's%20Flair%20Detection%20with%20Transfer%20Learning%20%2B%20EDA">Reddit's Flair Detection with Transfer Learning + EDA</a><br>
In this directory we have created a Reddits Flair Detector. Here we are not lettting the Embedding Layer to initialize it's random weights. We are using a TRANSFER LEARNING approach to train the model. We are using FastText crawl embeddings for transfer learning. These are pre-trained word embeddings trained and released by Facebook after training on 2 million words.<br><br>
