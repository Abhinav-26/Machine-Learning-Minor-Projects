# Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects
In this repository you can get some minor projects in the Machine Learning domain to learn and practise and increase your Skills. Also I will share my own projects which I did during some Internship which I did in the field of Machine Learning/ Deep Learning.

  Verzeo Internship
  </a><br>
In this Directory you can see my project which I got during my Machine Learning Internship at 
<a href="https://verzeo.in/">Verzeo</a><br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Co2%20Emission%20Prediction">Co2 Emission Prediction</a><br>
In this directory you can see a basic machine learning model on Carbondioxide Emission Prediction whihc has been created by using Linear Regression concept.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/K-Nearest%20Neighbors">K-Nearest Neighbors</a><br>
In this directory a basic machine learning model is being created for classifying the class of the new coustomers among 
1- Basic Service, 2- E-Service, 3- Plus Service, 4-Total Service.
