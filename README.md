We have used three pre-trained models in this minor project ie, <b>VGG16</b>, <b>Inception_v3</b> and <b>ResNet50</b> for predicting the breed of dog. In the File <b>Prediction Comparision</b> I have used the three models for the same image to check which gives the better accuracy and we concluded we got the best accurcay by Inception_v3 model. 

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Feature%20Selection%20and%20Modelling%20on%20KDDCup%20Network%20Intrusion%20Dataset">10. Feature Selection and Modelling on KDDCup Network Intrusion Dataset</a><br>
In this project we created a Machine Learning model to check the network is under attack or not. We have used following five feature selection techniques in a sequence to extract the best features from the dataset.
-	Correlation based feature selection
-	Univariate Feature Selection
-	Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
-	Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
-	Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)<br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Cat-Dog%20Prediction%20using%20CNN">11. Cat-Dog Prediction Using CNN</a><br>
In this Project I have build a Cat-Dog Prediction model using the concepts of CNN. This is a very basic project of CNN, DeepLearning. This is one of the most beginner friendly project that every beginner usually builds. This project will help you to clear the basic concepts CNN and how it can be implemented in image classification.

In this directory we have created a Movie Recomendation system using the concept of content based recomendation system. The dataset used is very large and hence it cannot be directly Uploaded into GitHub. But you can download the data directly from <a href="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/moviedataset.zip">here</a>. Unzip the data and use the respected csv files.<br>

In this directory we have created a Reddits Flair Detector. Here we are not lettting the Embedding Layer to initialize it's random weights. We are using a TRANSFER LEARNING approach to train the model. We are using FastText crawl embeddings for transfer learning. These are pre-trained word embeddings trained and released by Facebook after training on 2 million words.<br><br>
 ## Iris Flower Classification M.L. Project
 <a href ="https://github.com/Omgupta0312/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/nn/Iris"> 14. Iris Flower Analysics M.L. </a><br>
 In this M.L. project , A classification model is made to detect the types of Iris flower.Basically Iris flower has three classes named as Iris setosa,Iris versicolor and Iris virginica.These types of iris flower has different petal length & width and different sepal length & width. In the dataset each class has 50 intances each.3 training models have been used in this classification to get accurate and reliable results 1.LOGISTIC REGRESSION 2.k-nearest neigthbours and 3.DecisionTreeClassifier.
 conclusion : One class is linearly seperable from the others 2;latter are not linearly seperable from each other.<br><br>
 
 ## Computer Vision M.L. Project - Image Processing Project
 <a href="https://github.com/Omgupta0312/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/im2ps/Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/Classification/Computer%20Vision/Image%20to%20PencilSketch"> 15. Image To PencilSketch. </a><br>
Discription :-<br>
We need to read the image in RGB format and then convert it into a grayscale image.
This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo.
Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image,this will be our inverted grayscale image.
Inversion can be used to enhance the details.
Then we can finally create the pencilsketch by mixing the grayscale image with inverted blurry image. 
This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image.
We will need the OpenCv library of python to do all this stuff.<br><br>


<!-- ## Computer Vision M.L. Project - Motion Detector<br> -->
<a href="https://github.com/Adarsh-Saurabh/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/Classification/Computer%20Vision/Motion%20Detector">
16. Motion Detector</a>
<br>
Discription :-<br>
In this project we are capturing the video through webcam of our pc and after we convert each frame to grayscale image or say black&white image we subtract both images from each other. As we subtract only those places will be left as bright place who are diffrent from the previous frame hence motion detected. But at this moment we cant show this to the user and also there will be a lot of noise so we create a threshold value above this all are complete white and below all are complete dark. So after this we need to mark the area in which motion is detected. Therefore we mark that area and then show it to the end user.<br>
In process making a <strong>Motion Detector</strong><br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Adarsh-Saurabh/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/Classification/Computer%20Vision/EYE%20Filter">
17. Eye filter using <strong>OpenCV</strong></a><br>
Discription :-<br>
Hi I am making an eye filter similar to those on instagram and snapchat but it only works with images. Here I am detecting the eyes first. Then I am reading a filter image which I will replace as eyes. So now I will do is place the filter image over the eyes and congratulations it is done. <br>
For using this project you will need to install python, opencv and numpy and then you need to use a of a person in which eyes are clearly visible. We can also change the color and type of filter as we want but dont play with the fine tuned if statements or it may break the program. Enjoy!
