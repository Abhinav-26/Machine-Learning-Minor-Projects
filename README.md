# Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects
In this repository you can get some minor projects in the Machine Learning domain to learn and practise and increase your Skills. I will be sharing my own small projects which I did during learning ML and understanding the concepts of different algorithms and implementing it.

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Verzeo%20InternShip">
  Verzeo Internship
  </a><br>
In this Directory you can see my project which I got during my Machine Learning Internship at 
<a href="https://verzeo.in/">Verzeo</a>. The project that I did in this training was on appstore datset.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Co2%20Emission%20Prediction">Co2 Emission Prediction</a><br>
In this directory you can see a basic machine learning model on Carbondioxide Emission Prediction whihc has been created by using Linear Regression concept.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/K-Nearest%20Neighbors">K-Nearest Neighbors</a><br>
In this directory a basic machine learning model is being created for classifying the class of the new coustomers among 
1- Basic Service, 2- E-Service, 3- Plus Service, 4-Total Service.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Drug%20Prescribtion%20Using%20DecisionTree">Drug Prescribtion using Decision Tree</a><br>
In this directory I have created a model for predicting the drug which needs to be given to patients having the same disease as per the previous experience and the model created have a 100% accuracy, tested on the 30 of the dataset which was not given for training.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/SVM%20Cancer%20Prediction">SVM Cancer Prediction</a><br>
In this directory I have created a model using SVM algorithm. The dataset used for creating the model is a record of cell samples of the patients. The dataset consists of 699 records and I got accuracy around 95% with accuracy_score and f1 score.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor Projects/tree/master/Logistic%20Regression%20on%20Churn%20Dataset">Logistic Regression on Churn Dataset</a><br>
In this directory you can see a basic prediction using the concept of Logistic Regression. I have used the Churn dataset for predicting coustomer's churn.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Phone%20Price%20Range%20Prediction">Phone Price Prediction</a><br>
In this directory I have crrated a model for predicting the range of price of a phone. The range lies between 1,2,3 ie, low, medium and high budget. I have implemented the concepts of Univariate Feature Selection and Feature Importance for selecting features from the dataset and then created a model for prediction. Also I used have used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and KNN algorithms and I got better accuracy by using LogisticRegression algo in this case. I got accuracy around 96% for that.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Coustomer%20Segmentation%20using%20K-Means%20Clustering">Customer Sementation Using K-means Clustering</a><br>
In this dir I have used the concept of K-means Clustering and made a model using customer segmentation dataset. It helps to cluster records on the basis of graph plotted.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Cars%20Segmentation%20using%20Heirarichal%20Clustering">Cars Segmentation using Heirarichal Clustering</a><br>
In this direcory I have created a car segementation which may help you to classify the kinds of cars are more popular among coustomers and may help you to launch your car as per the survey. For this minor project I used the concept Hierarchical Clustering.

<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Machine-Learning-Minor-Projects/tree/master/Movie%20Recomendation">Movie Recomendation</a><br><br>
In this directory I have creates a Movie Recomendation system using the concept of content based recomendation system. The dataset used ie very large and henc eit cannot be directly Uploaded into GitHub. But you can download the data directly from <a href="moviedataset.zip https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/moviedataset.zip">here</a>
